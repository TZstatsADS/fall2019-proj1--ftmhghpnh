### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: Big Data Finds Music Bands In Other Genres Similar To Your Favorite Genre
+ This project is conducted by Fateme Sadat Haghpanah

+ Project summary: It is a brief study on the lyrics of musics of different bands and singers in different genre. It has been conducted using NLP techniques, such as text preprocessing and cleaning the data, topic modeling and word embeding on lyrics. The results repreented that lyrics in different genre can be clustred semantically and based on their content so well. Also, in every genre, there are some bands and artists whose lyrics are not same as every one in that genre and it is more similar to other genre rather that their! Forexample, there would be lots of pleasent suggestion for Metal Fans in other genre too!

Because the data size is huge, I created a reproducable doc where I do the same work on the sampled dataset.
