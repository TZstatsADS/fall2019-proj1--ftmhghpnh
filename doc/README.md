# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on Lyrics Analysis

### Reproduce Instructions:

Because the data size is big, I created a reproducible doc where I do the same work on the sampled dataset. 

+ I used python to create my report, so you need to provide your python path in the doc. You should change line 9 of the doc with your python path [In order to find your python path, run `which python` in terminal]

+ Install `reticulate` package in R to be able to work with python in R [install.packages("reticulate")].

+ Open a terminal, `cd` to doc folder and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required python packages.

+ Run `python -m spacy download en_core_web_md` in your terminal.

+ Run doc using knit and see the results!
